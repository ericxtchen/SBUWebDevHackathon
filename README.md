# Woodcode - Interactive LeetCode Learning Platform üå≥

Woodcode is an interactive web application that gamifies the LeetCode problem-solving experience by growing a virtual tree as you complete coding challenges. Each tree represents a different category of LeetCode problems, and your progress is visually represented through the growth of your tree.

## Current Features (MVP) üöÄ

- **Interactive Tree Growth**: Watch your tree grow as you complete LeetCode problems
- **Problem Categories**: Currently focused on Array problems
- **Checklist System**: Track your progress through a series of LeetCode problems
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback as you complete problems
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## How to Use üìù

1. Click on the tree to open the problem checklist
2. Complete the LeetCode problems in each section
3. Check off completed problems to see your tree grow
4. Each section (Tree A1, A2, A3) represents different difficulty levels

## Future Plans üéØ

### Phase 1: User Authentication
- User login system to save progress
- Cloud storage for problem completion status
- User profiles and achievements

### Phase 2: Additional Problem Categories
- Trees for different LeetCode categories:
  - Trees & Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Backtracking
  - Sliding Window
  - And more!

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Custom tree designs
- Problem difficulty indicators
- Time tracking for problem completion
- Community features and leaderboards

## Technologies Used üíª

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- SVG for tree animations
